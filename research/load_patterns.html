<h2>Details About Load Patterns for Prototype Evaluation</h2>

<div class="bloco">
Aiming to analyse the parallel application on different loads, four patterns&nbsp;were developed named: Constant, Ascending, Descending and Wave. Table&nbsp;1 and Figure 1 show the equation of each pattern and the template used&nbsp;in the tests. The iterations in this figure means the number of functions&nbsp;that are generated, resulting in the same number of numerical integrations.&nbsp;Additionally, the polynomial selected for tests does not matter in this case&nbsp;because of we are putting attention in the load variations and not in the&nbsp;result of the numerical integration itself.

Figure 2 shows a graphical representation of each pattern. The <em>x</em> axis in&nbsp;the graph of Figure 2 expresses the number of functions (one function per&nbsp;iteration) that are being tested, while the <em>y</em> axis informs the respective load.&nbsp;The load means the number of subintervals between limits <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>,&nbsp;which, in this experiment, are 1 and 10 respectively. The larger the number of&nbsp;intervals, the greater the computational load to generate the numerical integration&nbsp;of the function. For sake of simplicity, the same function is employed&nbsp;in the tests, but varying the number of subintervals for the integration.
